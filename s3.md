##  Move a bucket to another account
 <a name="bucket_account_transfer"></a>If you are working in a multi-account environment, you may ask yourself how to transfer a bucket to another account. Unfortunately there is currently no functionality to simply change the ownership of a S3 bucket. However you can copy the content from one bucket to another very easly. Replace ```<DestinationAccountId>``` with the ID of the AWS Account which includes the target bucket and ```<SourceAccountId>``` with the ID of the source Account. ```<SourceBucketName>``` is the name of the source bucket and ```<DestinationBucketName>``` is the name of the destination bucket.

### Source Bucket Policy 
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "S3AccessForDestinationBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"AWS": "<DestinationAccountId>"},
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket","s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<SourceBucketName>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<SourceBucketName>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### IAM Policy for user in the target account
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<SourceBucketName>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<SourceBucketName>/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<DestinationBucketName>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<DestinationBucketName>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Copy Content from Source to Destination
You need to configure your AWS ClI with the access key of the account which has the above policy attached. Execute the following command in a CLI. 
```shell
aws s3 sync s3://<SourceBucketName> s3://<DestinationBucketName>
```


## Allow access to bucket from accounts in the same organization
<a name="policy_organization"></a>The following policy allows read-only access to the bucket ```<bucket-name>``` for all accounts which belong to the organization defined in the bucket policy's condition.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowReadAccessForOrganizationsAccounts",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": [
                        "o-xxxxxxxxxx"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}```
